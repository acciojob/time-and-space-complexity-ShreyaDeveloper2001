	<h1>understanding Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>When analyzing algorithms, one crucial aspect to consider is their <strong>time complexity</strong>. Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms are those that have low time complexity, ensuring that they can handle larger inputs without becoming too slow.</p>
	<p><strong>Space complexity</strong>, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute. It's often measured in terms of auxiliary space and input space. For example, an algorithm with <strong>O(n)</strong> space complexity indicates that its memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
